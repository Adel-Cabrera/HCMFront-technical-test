In order to run the application locally, download and unzip this repo, then open a terminal on the current folder and type:

Main endpoint running locally:

`http://127.0.0.1:8000/show`

I used Django 3.1.3, Python 3.8.5 and Postgresql for this project. My only concern is about the database normalization and security of this webapp. But is working with all CRUD functionality.

Also this repository has 2 branches, already merged into this current `main branch`.

I find it challenging and fun to solve this technical test, I enjoyed the process, so i wanted to thank you for showing interest in my professional profile.
